# statnet.help
Beta test repository for statnet.help community list

This repository is being evaluated as a replacement for (or addition to) the old statnet help mailman listserv.  We will be beta testing GitHub's new "Discussions" feature as a way to track questions, and assessing whether the additional features of a repository (code sharing and editing) are practically useful.
